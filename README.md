Portfolio of design work at Carnegie Mellon University, Fall 2024.

# About Me
Name: Anesha Santhanam
Pronouns: she/her
Bio: I am currently a student in the Masters of Information Systems Management program at Carnegie Mellon University. I will be graduating in December 2024 and moving on to a full-time role at Google as a Technical Program Manager. I am originally from New Jersey and have a passion for the intersection of technology, business and design. I have a deep knowledge of technical skills such as full stack development, application development, coding languages (Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, HTML/CSS, SQL), database development, and data analytics. My background in business consists of creating my own small business which provides free STEM education to local communities, client management, financial management, invoicing, and statistics for management. My design background involves 2D and 3D animation using ToonBoom & Blender, Tinkercad design, cell animation, 3D printing, metalwork, Figma, UI/UX, wireframing, graphic design, and editing on Photoshop/Adobe After Effects. 

# What I Hope to Learn
I would like to put my skillsets in design, data analytics and technology together in order to represent data collected more accurately and clearly through digital mediums. This class will really help me understand which designs appeal most to the human eye as well as how to convey seemingly complex data in a simple, communicative way to individuals who may have little to no background knowledge about the dataset. I would like to use and apply these skills in the real world in presentations, meetings, and graphics that I create in the future.

## Visualizing Government Debt Using Tableau - Analysis
The different methods of visualization of the government debt to GDP ratio for multiple countries provide three different approaches and stories to the data, and in my opinion the best visualization is the third (my own) one. The first is a bar chart, which attempts to tell the story that Japan's % of GDP is the highest out of all of the other countries in the chart. Similarly, the heat map also tells the story that Japan's government debt to GDP ratio is relatively high/the highest compared to the other countries. The third visualization which I created also tells the story that Japan's government debt to GDP ratio is the highest out of the other countries, and that Estonia's government debt to GDP ratio is the lowest out of all of the countries. All graphs use some form of ranking, where "an item's position in an ordered list is important" (Visual Vocabulary). We can see Japan at the top or far left of the graph and Estonia at the bottom of the second and third graphs. The difference in the third visualization's story of both the highest and lowest values helps to add understanding to the graphs. 

There are some improvements that can be made to the first and second visualizations that I have represented in the differences made in the third visualization. The first visualization is a bar chart where the highest bar represents the highest ratio, which Japan has. A major issue with this chart is the coloring. Two bars are highlighted in light blue while the rest are in dark blue, and the highlighted bars add no meaning to the graph as they are not significant. Additionally, not all countries are labeled next to their respective bars. Only a few countries are labeled, so the reader does not know which countries the unlabeled bars represent. Lastly, there isn't a clear story. We see a possible maximum with Japan's bar, but nothing to highlight whether it is significant, good or bad. Regarding the second visualization, we see that the color scheme changes regarding the value. Higher values are darker and more orange, and lower values are more blue. The colors do not clearly indicate the story of whether high values are good/bad, but they do signify higher and lower values with darkness/color changes. However, the graph is quite cluttered and at first glance, it is difficult for the reader to identify what the graph is pointing out other than just stating values. 

In my third visualization, I made sure to create a story where the reader can look at the graph for a few seconds and get a good idea of what is happening. The most important thing I wanted to achieve with the graph was give clarity of focus by "reducing cognitive load and focusing on what matters," ("Six Principles for Designing Any Chart") which was the high/low ratio. The first thing I did was modify the title to reflect the content of the graph. Then, I wanted to tell the story of the countries with the highest and lowest government debt to GDP ratio, and wanted to make it clear that a high ratio was not good for the economy of the country. Therefore, I created a line graph with multiple lines to show the trajectory for each country, and colored all lines grey except Japan (highest ratio) which I colored red to indicate a bad ratio, and Estonia (lowest ratio) which I colored green to indicate a good ratio. This made the storytelling clear to show the trajectory over the years while clearly showing which countries have the best and worst ratios. 

# Critique By Design with Tableau

Critique Process:
1. Identify a publicly available visualization
2. Critique the visualization
3. Sketch new designs of the visualization
4. Gather feedback via interviews and documentation about the sketches
5. Translate this feedback and sketches into a new design of the visualization on Tableau
6. Publish this Tableau visualization as the new and improved version of the original

## Original Visualization
This visualization involves alcohol consumption for various countries. Each bar graph represents a year, as shown on the right. There is data for multiple years in this graph, which can be accessed by sliding the dot to the right or left to select a year. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92ae3318-645d-4234-8f8f-0cc85370da7d)

I selected this visualization because it was very interesting; not only did it have a large amount of data from different countries, but also different time periods. I immediately knew I wanted to compile information from 2000 to 2024 on alcohol usage and see what the differences were between the USA and other major countries. Additionally, alcohol usage has been the topic of research papers and projects I have done in the past, so this visualization also connects to my past work and gives me a chance to pursue a topic I am interested in while also learning more about the topic. The visualization layout also spoke to me as it was so simple. I wanted to challenge myself by choosing an already simple visualization and trying to make it even better, rather than choosing a cluttered visualization and simplifying it. This was definitely a challenge for me on how to convey so much information with such a large dataset in the way I thought would be most effective.

**Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here.  What stood out to you?  What did you find worked really well?  What didn't?  What, if anything, would you do differently?**
The first thing that stood out to me when looking at the graph was the title, which is very short and states "Alcohol consumption". Interpreting this title, I immediately thought that the data would show the amount of alcohol drank per country; immediately next, my eyes travelled to the bottom of the graph, where countries are listed in a row on the x-axis. The next thing I noticed were the many bars on the graph, which are all the same color. I noticed that the bars are organized from greatest on the left to least on the right. The main things that stood out to me on this graph were the title, the x-axis and the large number of same-colored, ordered bars on the graph. 

One thing that worked very well was the sorting of the bars. The bars are sorted from highest/greatest on the left and lowest/least on the right. This works well because I can easily know which value is the highest and lowest in terms of location on the graph. Additionally, something else that works well is the simplicity of the graph. Because there is only one color on the bars, a very short title and a large amount of white space, my eyes are able to focus on the title and then the data more easily than if the graph were cluttered. 

Unfortunately, there are many things about the visualization that do not work well. These are the elements which I would do differently. The first is the title. Although the title is simple, it does not fully represent the data. "Alcohol consumption" does not give information on the chart or how exactly the consumption is measured (amount drank, sales, trashed bottles, etc.). I would change the title to "Annual Sales of Alcohol in Different Countries (Litres Per Person Age 15+)" and remove the subtitle. The next part of the graph that doesn't work very well is the coloring. Because the coloring of all bars is the same, the story is not entirely clear. I would color all bars the same except the countries with the highest and lowest values, which I would color red for highest and green for lowest, to indicate that more alcohol consumption is not good. Additionally, not all countries are labeled on the graph, so a reader does not know all countries involved unless they click on individual bars. I would change this so that all countries are listed in a more organized matter so that information is not left out of the graph. Another issue is the measurement across graphs. For each year, the measurements on the Y-graph are different. This makes it very difficult to compare measurements of each year. I would fix this by creating a new graph encompassing multiple years so the reader can see trends of specific countries in their alcohol consumption. The final issue is that the graphs do not tell a story. This data is objective, but the tags are "health", "improving public health" and "harmful alcohol consumption." This puts a negative correlation to alcohol, so a reasonable story would be to highlight that it is negative to have a large alcohol intake for countries. I would tell this story by highlighting the higher values in red to draw a negative correlation to high alcohol consumption. 

**Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not?**
The primary audience for this tool is likely health advisory committees which are global and international; the data source is OECD (Organization for Economic Co-Operation) which is known for developing policy and data analysis across a multitude of countries which can be found in the data. The tags on the graph are "Health", "Improving Public Health", "Harmful alcohol consumption" and "Directorate for Employment, Labour and Social Affairs." These tags indicate that the visualization is meant for an audience which has an interest in alcohol negatively affecting public health internationally. 

I think the visualization is not reaching this audience. The reason is because despite the negative connotation to alcohol consumption in the tags and its negative impact on public health, there is nothing in the graph that shows that alcohol consumption is negative or impacting the countries in a worsening way to their health. Because of this, it is difficult for someone interested in the public health of their country to look at the graph and know whether or not alcohol consumption has affected their country in a negative way. There should be some correlation of color or indication on the graph for which countries have good (lower) amounts of alcohol consumption and which countries have bad (higher) amounts of alcohol consumption. 

**Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?  Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)**
This method was very successful in evaluating the data I selected. As I completed this form, I recognized more details of the visual that I hadn't yet considered and it made me think outside the box in order to evaluate it. Some measures that would be helpful are ranking individual features of the graph, such as color, order, title, etc. so that these individual rankings can prompt us to think harder about how each of these elements could be improved on their own and all together. Additionally, I think that one element of the layout which could be improved would be to include the chart of the 4 rankings (similar to how the Google Sheet was formatted for the previous design assignment) so that we can see where our visualization places amongst the four "boxes." This would give us a more visual representation of what the visualization is doing well vs. needs to be fixed. 

## Sketches
Completing the critique made me realize that while I could keep some elements of the original graph, the largest component which was lacking was a clear story. I wanted to tell a story of which countries were highest in alcohol usage and how this could be bad from a healthcare standpoint. I sketched out two designs to potentially use: the first was similar to the bar chart used to represent each year, just with different coloring and labeling to tell a story when showing the countries with the most and least alcohol consumption. The second graph was to provide an alternative to how the data was formatted; instead of individual bar graphs, it would be multiple lines telling the story overtime of specific countries and their alcohol consumptions. I presented both of these as alternatives to a redesign and asked for input on the sketches.

## Interviews and Peer Feedback
In my peer feedback on my sketches, I learned that the use of two graphs was a bit confusing for some, and most preferred the graph with the continuation of data over multiple years rather than the individual bar charts for one year at a time. I also learned from my peers in class that although the colors of red, green and grey worked to tell the story, the grey was a bit jarring and provided a dull look to my graph. It was recommended that I keep the color scheme but add a bit more color rather than coloring the other lines/bars grey. 

I interviewed two participants on my sketches. Their profiles and questions are below. 
**Participant A:** Full-Time Employee, 32
**Participant B:** Full-Time Student, 19

**What is the first thing that stands out to you in the visualization?**
**A:** The green and red colors, the red seems like something negative and the green seems like something positive.
**B:** The colors, assuming red and green is high and low, the year stood out in the graph and spikes and dips also stood out in the second graph.

**Are there any parts of the visualization that seem unclear?**
**A:** Be careful with the bar widths, because it may seem unclear of bars with different widths, but this may just be because it was sketched.
**B:** In the first graph, it is hard to tell what the exact Y-values are in the bar graph, maybe it would help if there were gridlines or written measurements. Also, some acronyms for countries may be unknown by the common reader.

**Do you think that the graph conveys its message quickly and effectively?**
**A:** Yes, it is organized and draws attention to which countries are the highest and lowest in drinking. I think the line graph depicts this better than the bar graph and gives us the full picture. 
**B:** Yes effectively, and fairly quickly because it took a little bit of time to read the country acronyms for the lines on the second graph.

**Is there anything about the visualization that seems surprising or confusing?**
**A:** The first bar graph seems like it is not needed, and I am more interested in the trends for each country in the second line graph. 
**B:** The data points are not as accurate between graphs, likely because this needed to be quickly sketched.

**Who do you think is the intended audience of this visualization?**
**A:** Health workers.
**B:** Healthcare boards and leadership at alcohol companies.

**Do you think two graphs are necessary for the full picture or only one?**
**A:** It would depend on the messages being conveyed; one is for one year while the other is across years. Both are relevant if someone wants the big picture rather than just for a year, but I personally prefer the line graph for a larger picture of trends over time. 
**B:** The first graph may not be necessary if you want to view more than one year, and it is extremely helpful to view the trends of each country.

**What is one thing you like about this visualization?**
**A:** It is very to-the-point.
**B:** The colors stand out and indicate positive and negative connotations behind alcohol use easily. 

**What is one thing you dislike about this visualization:**
**A:** There should be slightly more clean-ness in the final design such as the connection of the lines and distance between bars. 
**B:** I wish the countries were spelled out because I don't know all the acronyms.

**What is one thing you would change about this visualization?**
**A:** The titles should be aligned better and the year should be included in the title rather than directly on the graph to reduce where the reader looks.
**B:** I would make the title clearer rather than including text in multiple places and change the colors a bit to make it less gray. 

## Findings from Interviews
From the interviews, I realized that a common pattern was choosing the second line graph over the first bar graph alternative. This made it clear along with the peer feedback from class that the right visualization to go with was the line graph in order to properly encompass more data in a way that shows trends over time. I also learned from the interview feedback that a few things were unclear to the viewer, such as the acronym labelling for countries. Therefore it would be more logical to spell out the country names so that viewers are not confused. The title also needed changing, as I had used a title and somewhat of a subtitle and description in my graph, but this amount of text was confusing and led the interviewees to take more time to read it. I would be better off combining this information concisely in a clear title so that the graph can be read quickly. I will also play around with the changes of the color scheme to see if I can reduce the stark contrast in the red and green colors vs the grey colors in the chart. 

## Final Visualization

For my final visualization, I made sure to do the following:
1. I created a line graph, with multiple lines, each representing a country and the trends in how many litres of alcohol were consumed per year.
2. I created a color scheme, going from red to green, with red indicating a higher amount of alcohol consumption and green indicating a lower amount of alcohol consumption. The line which was the darkest red was the highest consumption and the line which was the darkest green was the lowest consumption.
4. I limited the amount of data used, as the data source has a large amount of data which is not necessarily all important for telling the story I wanted to create. Therefore, I chose the years 2000 to 2024 to show past to current trends, and I chose a few countries which have been at the top and bottom of the alcohol consumption range, and which are popular/known among people in the U.S., as this chart is in English and being presented to an audience of U.S. students.
5. I changed the title to be more concise and include additional information which I planned originally to put as subtitles, such as the measurement being liters per person 15+. I labeled the X and Y axis clearly so that the viewer could know what the measurements were as well.
6. I labeled each individual line on the graph to show which country it was; instead of using abbreviations, I made sure to spell out the whole country name so that the viewer knew which country belonged to which line. I placed the countries at the beginning of the lines so that viewers would not have to go all the way to the end of the line to find out which country it belonged to.

# Final Design Project
## Part 1: Final Project Overview
**Outline**
My final project will show what the best methods of dating are for adults in the United States. With online options, dating has become both easier and more complicated. There are several methods to find your partner: online through dating apps, in-person at work, school, or another location, and even reality dating shows. These methods have varying amounts of success, and my study will pinpoint which methods are the most effective for which populations. Data is segmented by the following factors: gender, sexual orientation, and location, which will be in the United States. 
The story I will tell with the data is for each person in the audience (for example, if someone in the audience is heterosexual and a man), they will be able to know which method of dating, statistically, will be the most successful for them. Due to the variety in my data and different demographic factors I am considering, there should be a relatable aspect of the results for every single person in the audience I am presenting to. 
I will also compare trends over time generally, such as whether online dating is becoming as successful as it is popular. I will provide this information to analyze trends and patterns in what works best for dating in early adulthood in the United States. 
The way I anticipate the story unfolding is to first get the audience excited about potential dating options. Then, I will outline current trends and what is increasing/decreasing in success and popularity. After this, I will tell them what the worst options, statistically, are. This will create a dip in my "story chart" as it may bring down the mood and even surprise people. After this, I will tell them what the best options are and create a peak in my story as they may relate to the options provided. After this, I will level out at the peak by providing information on specific demographic information and which options are the most successful; this way my audience can see themselves visualized in the data and relate to the results.

I will be using a mix of datasets, articles, and research studies in order to inform my data. The links above include data on the method of dating (reality TV show, in-person, online), the demographic information for daters in the United States ages 18-29 (and occasionally other age groups) which include age, race, gender, and sexual orientation, and trends across recent years for different methods and their popularities. I also include data from revenue streams made through dating apps to show which dating apps have the most popularity, users, and success rates. I will be using this data to inform my conclusions about which methods have the most success rates for which demographics. 



**Method/Medium**
I will be developing interacting graphs in Tableau and using Figma for other prototyping for my final site. To create the interactive site, I will use Shorthand and Flourish (either one of them or a mix of both) and I will integrate my Tableau graphs into the site.
