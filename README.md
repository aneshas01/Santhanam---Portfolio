# Santhanam---Portfolio
Portfolio of design work at Carnegie Mellon University, Fall 2024.

# About Me
Name: Anesha Santhanam
Pronouns: she/her
Bio: I am currently a student in the Masters of Information Systems Management program at Carnegie Mellon University. I will be graduating in December 2024 and moving on to a full-time role at Google as a Technical Program Manager. I am originally from New Jersey and have a passion for the intersection of technology, business and design. I have a deep knowledge of technical skills such as full stack development, application development, coding languages (Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, HTML/CSS, SQL), database development, and data analytics. My background in business consists of creating my own small business which provides free STEM education to local communities, client management, financial management, invoicing, and statistics for management. My design background involves 2D and 3D animation using ToonBoom & Blender, Tinkercad design, cell animation, 3D printing, metalwork, Figma, UI/UX, wireframing, graphic design, and editing on Photoshop/Adobe After Effects. 

# What I Hope to Learn
I would like to put my skillsets in design, data analytics and technology together in order to represent data collected more accurately and clearly through digital mediums. This class will really help me understand which designs appeal most to the human eye as well as how to convey seemingly complex data in a simple, communicative way to individuals who may have little to no background knowledge about the dataset. I would like to use and apply these skills in the real world in presentations, meetings, and graphics that I create in the future.

## Visualizing Government Debt Using Tableau - Analysis
The different methods of visualization of the government debt to GDP ratio for multiple countries provide three different approaches and stories to the data, and in my opinion the best visualization is the third (my own) one. The first is a bar chart, which attempts to tell the story that Japan's % of GDP is the highest out of all of the other countries in the chart. Similarly, the heat map also tells the story that Japan's government debt to GDP ratio is relatively high/the highest compared to the other countries. The third visualization which I created also tells the story that Japan's government debt to GDP ratio is the highest out of the other countries, and that Estonia's government debt to GDP ratio is the lowest out of all of the countries. All graphs use some form of ranking, where "an item's position in an ordered list is important" (Visual Vocabulary). We can see Japan at the top or far left of the graph and Estonia at the bottom of the second and third graphs. The difference in the third visualization's story of both the highest and lowest values helps to add understanding to the graphs. 

There are some improvements that can be made to the first and second visualizations that I have represented in the differences made in the third visualization. The first visualization is a bar chart where the highest bar represents the highest ratio, which Japan has. A major issue with this chart is the coloring. Two bars are highlighted in light blue while the rest are in dark blue, and the highlighted bars add no meaning to the graph as they are not significant. Additionally, not all countries are labeled next to their respective bars. Only a few countries are labeled, so the reader does not know which countries the unlabeled bars represent. Lastly, there isn't a clear story. We see a possible maximum with Japan's bar, but nothing to highlight whether it is significant, good or bad. Regarding the second visualization, we see that the color scheme changes regarding the value. Higher values are darker and more orange, and lower values are more blue. The colors do not clearly indicate the story of whether high values are good/bad, but they do signify higher and lower values with darkness/color changes. However, the graph is quite cluttered and at first glance, it is difficult for the reader to identify what the graph is pointing out other than just stating values. 

In my third visualization, I made sure to create a story where the reader can look at the graph for a few seconds and get a good idea of what is happening. The most important thing I wanted to achieve with the graph was give clarity of focus by "reducing cognitive load and focusing on what matters," ("Six Principles for Designing Any Chart") which was the high/low ratio. The first thing I did was modify the title to reflect the content of the graph. Then, I wanted to tell the story of the countries with the highest and lowest government debt to GDP ratio, and wanted to make it clear that a high ratio was not good for the economy of the country. Therefore, I created a line graph with multiple lines to show the trajectory for each country, and colored all lines grey except Japan (highest ratio) which I colored red to indicate a bad ratio, and Estonia (lowest ratio) which I colored green to indicate a good ratio. This made the storytelling clear to show the trajectory over the years while clearly showing which countries have the best and worst ratios. 

## Critique By Design with Tableau

# Original Visualization
This visualization involves alcohol consumption for various countries. Each bar graph represents a year, as shown on the right. There is data for multiple years in this graph, which can be accessed by sliding the dot to the right or left to select a year.

**Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here.  What stood out to you?  What did you find worked really well?  What didn't?  What, if anything, would you do differently?**
The first thing that stood out to me when looking at the graph was the title, which is very short and states "Alcohol consumption". Interpreting this title, I immediately thought that the data would show the amount of alcohol drank per country; immediately next, my eyes travelled to the bottom of the graph, where countries are listed in a row on the x-axis. The next thing I noticed were the many bars on the graph, which are all the same color. I noticed that the bars are organized from greatest on the left to least on the right. The main things that stood out to me on this graph were the title, the x-axis and the large number of same-colored, ordered bars on the graph. 

One thing that worked very well was the sorting of the bars. The bars are sorted from highest/greatest on the left and lowest/least on the right. This works well because I can easily know which value is the highest and lowest in terms of location on the graph. Additionally, something else that works well is the simplicity of the graph. Because there is only one color on the bars, a very short title and a large amount of white space, my eyes are able to focus on the title and then the data more easily than if the graph were cluttered. 

Unfortunately, there are many things about the visualization that do not work well. These are the elements which I would do differently. The first is the title. Although the title is simple, it does not fully represent the data. "Alcohol consumption" does not give information on the chart or how exactly the consumption is measured (amount drank, sales, trashed bottles, etc.). I would change the title to "Annual Sales of Alcohol in Different Countries (Litres Per Person Age 15+)" and remove the subtitle. The next part of the graph that doesn't work very well is the coloring. Because the coloring of all bars is the same, the story is not entirely clear. I would color all bars the same except the countries with the highest and lowest values, which I would color red for highest and green for lowest, to indicate that more alcohol consumption is not good. Additionally, not all countries are labeled on the graph, so a reader does not know all countries involved unless they click on individual bars. I would change this so that all countries are listed in a more organized matter so that information is not left out of the graph. Another issue is the measurement across graphs. For each year, the measurements on the Y-graph are different. This makes it very difficult to compare measurements of each year. I would fix this by creating a new graph encompassing multiple years so the reader can see trends of specific countries in their alcohol consumption. The final issue is that the graphs do not tell a story. This data is objective, but the tags are "health", "improving public health" and "harmful alcohol consumption." This puts a negative correlation to alcohol, so a reasonable story would be to highlight that it is negative to have a large alcohol intake for countries. I would tell this story by highlighting the higher values in red to draw a negative correlation to high alcohol consumption. 

**Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not?**
The primary audience for this tool is likely health advisory committees which are global and international; the data source is OECD (Organization for Economic Co-Operation) which is known for developing policy and data analysis across a multitude of countries which can be found in the data. The tags on the graph are "Health", "Improving Public Health", "Harmful alcohol consumption" and "Directorate for Employment, Labour and Social Affairs." These tags indicate that the visualization is meant for an audience which has an interest in alcohol negatively affecting public health internationally. 

I think the visualization is not reaching this audience. The reason is because despite the negative connotation to alcohol consumption in the tags and its negative impact on public health, there is nothing in the graph that shows that alcohol consumption is negative or impacting the countries in a worsening way to their health. Because of this, it is difficult for someone interested in the public health of their country to look at the graph and know whether or not alcohol consumption has affected their country in a negative way. There should be some correlation of color or indication on the graph for which countries have good (lower) amounts of alcohol consumption and which countries have bad (higher) amounts of alcohol consumption. 

**Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?  Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)**
This method was very successful in evaluating the data I selected. As I completed this form, I recognized more details of the visual that I hadn't yet considered and it made me think outside the box in order to evaluate it. Some measures that would be helpful are ranking individual features of the graph, such as color, order, title, etc. so that these individual rankings can prompt us to think harder about how each of these elements could be improved on their own and all together. Additionally, I think that one element of the layout which could be improved would be to include the chart of the 4 rankings (similar to how the Google Sheet was formatted for the previous design assignment) so that we can see where our visualization places amongst the four "boxes." This would give us a more visual representation of what the visualization is doing well vs. needs to be fixed.
